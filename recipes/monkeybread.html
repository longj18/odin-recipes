    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>3 (12oz) can refrigerated biscuits, separated and cut into quarters</li>
        <li>3 apples, peeled, cored, and chopped</li>
        <li>1/2 cup margarine</li>
        <li>1 up packed brown sugar</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a tube pan.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Combine the sugar and cinnamon together in a large sealable plastic bag; add the biscuit dough in batches of
            6 to 8 pieces and shake to coat. Alternate layers of the chopped apple and the coated dough pieces in the
            prepared pan.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Melt the margarine in a small saucepan over medium heat; stir the brown sugar into the melted margarine.
            Bring to a boil; cook at a boil for 1 minute, remove from heat, and pour over the apple and biscuit layers.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cooked through, about 35 minutes. Allow the bread to cool in the pan for 10
            minutes before turning out onto a plate to serve.</li>
