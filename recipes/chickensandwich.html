    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I tried to make a copycat Popeyes® fried chicken sandwich and ended up with a hybrid between that and the one
        from Chick-fil-A®. So you get the best of both worlds and what's more, this DIY version never runs out, not even
        on Sundays. </p>

        <h4>Breading:</h4>
        <li>1 1/3 cups all purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dry ranch dressing mix</li>
        <hr>
        <h4>Wash</h4>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1/2 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
        <hr>
        <h4>The Rest</h4>
        <li>canola oil for frying</li>
        <li>4 soft hamburger buns, toasted and buttered</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons mayonnaise, or to taste</li>
        <li>12 dill pickle slices, or to taste</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <hr>
    <ol> <span>Steps</span>
        <li>Whisk buttermilk, salt, hot sauce, and ranch dressing mix together in a large bowl. Cut diagonal slits into
            the thick ends of chicken breasts and toss into marinade until well coated. Transfer to the refrigerator to
            marinate for 2 to 4 hours.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the breading: Mix flour, cornstarch, salt, pepper, cayenne, and ranch dressing mix together
            in a shallow dish.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Make the wash: Whisk egg, buttermilk, and milk together in another bowl until combined.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Use a fork to pull chicken from marinade, letting any excess drip off. Dip into the breading to coat both
            sides; shake off any excess. Dip into egg wash mixture to saturate surface; return to breading to coat,
            shake off excess, and repeat once more. Let sit on a wire rack to dry, at least 15 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer to between 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <br>
        <li>Fry chicken breasts in the hot oil until golden, crispy, and no longer pink in the centers, 4 to 5 minutes,
            flipping halfway through. Transfer to a plate topped with crinkled up aluminum foil to prevent bottoms from
            getting soggy.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Spread mayonnaise over hamburger bun halves. Stuff with pickles and chicken.</li>
    </ol>
